## Examples
Note: 
* If you use Windows device, please specify cli-kintone.exe
* Please set the PATH to cli-kintone to match your local environment beforehand.

### Export all columns from an app
```
cli-kintone --export -a <APP_ID> -d <FQDN> -t <API_TOKEN>
```
### Export the specified columns to csv file as Shift-JIS encoding
```
cli-kintone --export -a <APP_ID> -d <FQDN> -e sjis -c "$id, name1, name2" -t <API_TOKEN> > <OUTPUT_FILE>
```
### Import specified file into an App
```
cli-kintone --import -a <APP_ID> -d <FQDN> -e sjis -t <API_TOKEN> -f <INPUT_FILE>
```
Records are updated and/or added if the import file contains either an $id column (that represents the Record Number field), or a column representing a key field (denoted with a * symbol before the field code name, such as "\*mykeyfield").  

If the value in the $id (or key field) column matches a record number value, that record will be updated.  
If the value in the $id (or key field) column is empty, a new record will be added.  
If the value in the $id (or key field) column does not match with any record number values, the import process will stop, and an error will occur.  
If an $id (or key field) column does not exist in the file, new records will be added, and no records will be updated.

### Export and download attachment files to ./mydownloads directory
```
cli-kintone --export -a <APP_ID> -d <FQDN> -t <API_TOKEN> -b mydownloads
```
### Import and upload attachment files from ./myuploads directory
> :warning: WARNING
>- If the flag "-b" has NOT been specified, even though value of attachment fields in csv is empty or not, attachment fields will be skipped and not updated to kintone.
>
>- If the flag "-b" has been specified and value of attachment fields in csv is empty (empty is mean leave blank or ""), the data of attachment fields after importing to kintone will be removed.
>   - The conditions to remove all of attachment files
>       - The flag "-b" has been specified with directory path is required.
>       - Attachment columns are required for csv file but directory path is empty in csv.
>       - Attachment files are optional.
>   - The conditions to remove part of attachment files and update part of them
>       - The flag "-b" has been specified with directory path is required.
>       - Attachment columns are required for csv file.
>       - Attachment files are required if there's only part of them will be updated.
>
>Ex: CSV file to removed files in attachment fields

>"2","Sarah Jones","HR",""
>```
>&nbsp;

```
cli-kintone --import -a <APP_ID> -d <FQDN> -t <API_TOKEN> -b myuploads -f <INPUT_FILE>
```
### Import and update by selecting a key to bulk update
> :warning: WARNING
>
>The error message `The "$id" field and update key fields cannot be specified together in CSV import file.` will be displayed when both "$id" and key fields are specified in CSV import file.

The key to bulk update must be specified within the INPUT_FILE by placing an * in front of the field code name,  
e.g. “update_date",“*id",“status".

```
cli-kintone --import -a <APP_ID> -d <FQDN> -e sjis -t <API_TOKEN> -f <INPUT_FILE>
```
### Import CSV from line 25 of the input file
```
cli-kintone --import -a <APP_ID> -d <FQDN> -t <API_TOKEN> -f <INPUT_FILE> -l 25
```
### Import from standard input (stdin)
```
printf "name,age\nJohn,37\nJane,29" | cli-kintone --import -a <APP_ID> -d <FQDN> -t <API_TOKEN>
```

## Restrictions
* The limit of each file size for uploading to attachments field is 10MB.
* Client certificates cannot be used with cli-kintone.
* The following record data cannot be retrieved: Category, Status, Field group.
* The following fields cannot be retrieved if they are set inside a Field group: Record number, Created by, Created datetime, Updated by, Updated datetime, Blank space, Label, Border.

## Restriction of Encode/Decode
* Windows command prompt may not display characters correctly like "譁�蟄怜喧縺�".  
  This is due to compatibility issues between Chinese & Japanese characters and the Windows command prompt.
  * Chinese (Traditional/Simplified): Display wrong even if exporting with gbk or big5 encoding.
  * Japanese: Display wrong even if exporting with sjis or euc-jp encoding.
  
  In this case, display the data by specifying utf-8 encoding like below:
  ```
  cli-kintone --export -a <APP_ID> -d <FQDN> -e utf-8
  ```
  *This issue only occurs when displaying data on Windows command prompt. Data import/export with other means work fine with gbk, big5, sjis and euc-jp encoding.
